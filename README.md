# CS3041-ExtraCredit

# This project is my final project for CS3041 HCI. 
# The application here is called ChoreMaster 
# ChoreMaster is designed for roommates trying to evenly and fairly divide chores 
# ChoreMaster allows the user to track their own chore progress as well as that of their roommates 
# ChoreMaster is desinged to allow users to add to their chore list and add a new roommate in the event that your living situation changes 
# ChoreMaster also has a feature allowing users to find warnings associated with common cleaning products such as bleach
# ChoreMaster was designed on AdobeXD and the link can be find in this repository
